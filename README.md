# Modeling Malware as a Language

#### This repository presents an experimental setup which may be used to test the feasibility of modeling malware as a language. The model is built through converting malware instances to textual instances such that malware differences may be computed as document distances. This model may be used for malware classification in a way analogous to text document classification.

## Setup
### Dependencies
* bash
* python
* python modules sys, os, gensim, pickle

### Dataset
* Any malware dataset containing disassembled malware instances may be used. Note that, for this experimental setup, the dataset must be labeled by malware family/class.

### Expected Directory Structure
Running this experiment will add some directories to your directory structure:
* malware_by_class: contains directories of malware instances, assembled by class
* malware_by_class/<class>: contains malware instances of class <class>
* parsed_malware: contains parsed malware instances
* results: contains classification results
* results/classifications: contains parsed classification results

### Running an Experiment
1. ./collect_data_k_nn.sh <num_malware_per_class> <malware_source_dir>
2. ./parse_data_k_nn.sh
3. ./run_tests_gensim_k_nn.sh <word2vec_alg> <word2vec_window_size>

* (optional) You may compute confidence levels by running parse_confidence.sh
